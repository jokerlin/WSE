The measured data alone, usually represented as a [[point cloud]], lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] surfaces, or a [[computer assisted design|CAD]] model.\n\nReverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products, or to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.==Reverse engineering for military applications==\nReverse engineering is often used by militaries in order to copy other nations' technologies, devices, or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by [[military intelligence|intelligence]] operations. It was often used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. Well-known examples from WWII and later include:\n* [[Jerry can]]: British and American forces noticed that the Germans had gasoline cans with an excellent design. They reverse-engineered copies of those cans. The cans were popularly known as \"Jerry cans\".\n* [[Tupolev Tu-4]]: Three American [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bombers on missions over [[Japan]] were forced to land in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The Soviets, who did not have a similar strategic bomber, decided to copy the B-29. Within a few years, they had developed the Tu-4, a near-perfect copy.\n* [[V2 Rocket]]: Technical documents for the V2 and related technologies were captured by the Western Allies at the end of the war. Soviet and captured German engineers had to reproduce technical documents and plans, working from captured hardware, in order to make their clone of the rocket, the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]], which began the postwar Soviet rocket program that led to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] and the beginning of the [[space race]].\n* [[Vympel K-13|K-13/R-3S]] missile ([[NATO reporting name]] '''AA-2 Atoll'''), a Soviet reverse-engineered copy of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], was made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese [[MiG-17]] without exploding. The missile became lodged within the airframe, and the pilot returned to base with what Russian scientists would describe as a university course in missile development.\n* [[BGM-71 TOW]] Missile: In May 1975, negotiations between Iran and Hughes Missile Systems on co-production of the TOW and Maverick missiles stalled over disagreements in the pricing structure, the subsequent [[1979 revolution]] ending all plans for such co-production. Iran was later successful in reverse-engineering the missile and are currently producing their own copy: the [[Toophan]].\n* China has reversed engineered many examples of Western and Russian hardware, from fighter aircraft to missiles and [[HMMWV]] cars.\n* During the Second World War, British military intelligence at the Bletchley Park centre studied captured German \"Enigma\" message encryption machines. Their operation was then simulated on electro-mechanical devices called \"Bombes\" that tried all the possible scrambler settings of the \"Enigma\" machines to help break the coded messages sent by the Germans.\n\n==Legality==\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n* [[Antikythera mechanism]]\n* [[Benchmarking]]\n* [[Bus analyzer]]\n* [[Chonda]]\n* [[Clean room design]]\n* [[coordinate-measuring machine|CMM]]\n* [[Code morphing]]\n* [[Connectix Virtual Game Station]]\n* [[Cryptanalysis]]\n* [[Decompiler]]\n* [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA)\n* [[Forensic engineering]]\n* [[Industrial CT scanning]]\n* [[Interactive Disassembler]]\n* [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]]\n* [[3d scanner#Triangulation|Laser scanner]]\n* [[List of production topics]]\n* [[Logic analyzer]]\n* [[Paycheck (film)]]\n* [[Software archaeology]]\n* [[3d scanner#Structured light|Structured light digitizer]]\n* [[Value engineering]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |title=[[Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering]] |last=Eilam |first=Eldad |year=2005 |publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]] |isbn=0764574817 |page=595 }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=11966 |author=James, Dick |title=Reverse Engineering Delivers Product Knowledge; Aids Technology Spread |accessdate=2009-02-03 |work=Electronic Design |publisher=Penton Media, Inc |date=January 19, 2006 }}\n*{{Cite book |title=Reverse Engineering \u2013 An Industrial Perspective |last=Raja |first=Vinesh |coauthors=Fernandes, Kiran J. |year=2008 |publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-1-84628-855-5 |page=242}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://ewh.ieee.org/r5/denver/sscs/References/2007_09_Torrance.pdf |author=Thumm, Mike |title=Talking Tactics |accessdate=2009-02-03 |work=IEEE 2007 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC) |publisher=IEEE, Inc |year=2007 }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.reversingproject.info |author=Cipresso, Teodoro |title=Software Reverse Engineering Education |accessdate=2009-08-22 |work=SJSU Master's Thesis |publisher=ProQuest UML |year=2009 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks}}\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

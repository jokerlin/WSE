One very famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-[[IBM]] [[BIOS]] implementation.\r\n\r\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] exempts from the its circumvention ban some acts of reverse engineering aimed at interoperability of file formats and protocalls ([http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1201.html 17 USC 1201](f)), but judges in key cases have ignored this law.\r\n\r\nThe [[Samba software]], which allows systems that are not running [[Microsoft Windows]] systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering, since the Samba project had to reverse engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate this. The [[WINE]] project does the same thing for the [[Windows API]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] is one party doing this for the [[Microsoft Office]] file formats.\r\n\r\n==Reverse engineering as a competitive activity==\r\n\r\n'''Reverse engineering''' is also a competitive activity, used to analyze, for instance, how a competitor's product works, what it does, who manufactures it, what components it consists of, estimate costs, identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.\r\n\r\n==Miscellaneous==\r\n\r\nThe verb, \"to reverse-engineer\" should have a hyphen.\r\n\r\n==See also==\r\n\r\n*[[Clean room implementation]]", "timestamp": "2003-05-30T16:51:45Z", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "revid": 1097985, "contentmodel": "wikitext", "user": "Nixdorf", "parentid": 979410}], "title": "Reverse engineering"}}}}

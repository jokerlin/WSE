The [[verb]] form is '''to reverse-engineer''', spelled with a [[hyphen]].\n\nReverse engineering is commonly done to avoid [[copyright]]s on desired functionality, and may be used for avoiding [[patent]] law, though this is a bit risky: patents apply to the functionality, not a specific implementation of it.\n\nReverse engineering is a often used by [[military]], in order to copy other nations' [[technology]], parts of which have been obtained by [[intelligence]] operations. It was often used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]].\n\nReverse engineering software or hardware systems for the purposes of [[interoperability]], for example in order to support undocumented file formats or hardware peripherals, is mostly believed to be legal, though patent owners often aggressively pursue their patents.\n\nOther purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection (\"[[software cracking|cracking]]\"), circumvention of access restrictions often present in [[consumer electronics]] and customization of [[embedded systems]], for example engine management systems.\n\n==Reverse engineering of electronic components==\n\n[[Coordinate-measuring machine]]s (CMM) can be used to [[digitize]] a circuit and the information can be utilised in computer-aided modelling. \nNew and improved techniques in reverse engineering include [[laser scanning]] which, as the name implies, uses laser beams to scan across the surface of components of any shape and display the results in real time.\n\n==Reverse engineering of software==\n\nReverse engineering can also apply to [[software]].\nFor example, reverse engineering of binaries for the [[Java platform]] can be accomplished using [http://www.ARGOuml.org ARGOuml.org]. One very famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-[[International Business Machines|IBM]] implementation of [[BIOS]].\n\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] exempts from the circumvention ban some acts of reverse engineering aimed at interoperability of file formats and protocols ([http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1201.html 17 USC 1201](f)), but judges in key cases have ignored this law, since it is acceptable to circumvent restrictions for use, but not for access.\n\nThe [[Samba software]], which allows systems that are not running [[Microsoft Windows]] systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering, since the Samba project had to reverse-engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate this. The [[WINE]] project does the same thing for the [[Windows API]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] is one party doing this for the [[Microsoft Office]] file formats.\n\nReverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.  The two main groups of reverse engineering is analysis through observation of information exchange (most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering), [[disassembly]] using a [[disassembler]], or [[decompilation]] using a [[decompiler]].\n\n==Reverse engineering as business research==\n\n'''Reverse engineering''' is also used by businesses to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyze, for instance, how a competitor's product works, what it does, who manufactures it, what components it consists of, estimate costs, identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.\n\n'''Value engineering''' is a related activity also used by business. It involves deconstructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Clean room design]]\n*[[Decompilation]]\n*[[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]\n*[[Interactive Disassembler]]\n*[[Value engineering]]\n*[[List of production topics]]\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.conus.info/ Low-level software code analysis]\n* [http://www.bomarc.org Contractable electronics reverse engineering firm.]\n* [http://reverse-engineering.net/ Reverse Code Engineering Community]\n* [http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigmil/RevEng/ Introduction to Reverse Engineering Software], preprint of a book by [[Mike Perry]] and [[Nasko Oskov]].\n* [http://www.heaventools.com/PE_Explorer_disassembler.htm Win32 DisAssembler]\n* [http://revenge.berlios.de/ Information for people interested in reverse engineering]\n* [http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/ReverseEngineering/ Overview of reverse engineering and program transformation]\n* [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/01/25/smithsonian.cold.war/ CNN: How Soviets copied America's best bomber during WWII]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/tu-4.htm Reverse engineering of Tu-4 on GlobalSecurity.org]\n* [http://reformed-theology.org/html/books/best_enemy/chapter_05.htm AGATHA from APPLE II and other computer r.e.]\n* [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pettypi/elevon/baugher_us/b029-29.html Tu-4 Soviet Copy of the B-29]\n* [http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s822349.htm Third World Missiles]\n* Article \"[http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw44/varady.html Reverse Engineering Shapes]\" by [[Tam\u00e1s V\u00e1rady]]\n* Article on [http://www.jenkins-ip.com/serv/serv_6.htm legal considerations] by [[David C.

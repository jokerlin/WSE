The [[verb]] form is '''to reverse-engineer''', spelled with a [[hyphen]].\r\n\r\nReverse-engineering is commonly done to avoid [[copyright]]s on desired functionality, and may be used for avoiding [[patent]] law, though this is a bit risky: patents apply to the functionality, not a specific implementation of it.\r\n\r\nReverse-engineering things (like software) for the purposes of [[interoperability]] (i.e. supporting file formats etc.) is mostly believed to be legal, though patent owners often agressively pursue their patents.\r\n\r\n==Reverse engineering of electronic components==\r\n\r\n[[Coordinate-measuring machines]] (CMM) can be used to [[digitise]] a circuit and the information can be utilised in computer-aided modelling. \r\nNew and improved techniques in reverse engineering include [[laser scanning]] which, as the name implies, uses laser beams to scan across the surface of components of any shape and display the results in real time.\r\n\r\n==Reverse engineering of software==\r\n\r\nReverse engineering can also apply to [[software]].\r\nFor example, reverse engineering of binaries for the [[Java platform]] can be accomplished using [http://www.ARGOuml.org ARGOuml.org]. One very famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-[[International Business Machines|IBM]] implementation of [[BIOS]].\r\n\r\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] exempts from the circumvention ban some acts of reverse engineering aimed at interoperability of file formats and protocols ([http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1201.html 17 USC 1201](f)), but judges in key cases have ignored this law.\r\n\r\nThe [[Samba software]], which allows systems that are not running [[Microsoft Windows]] systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering, since the Samba project had to reverse engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate this. The [[WINE]] project does the same thing for the [[Windows API]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] is one party doing this for the [[Microsoft Office]] file formats.\r\n\r\nReverse engineering of software can be accomplished by [[decompilation]] or [[disassembly]]. The leading product for disassemblying binaries is [http://www.datarescue.com/idabase/index.htm InteractiveDisAssembler].\r\n\r\n==Reverse engineering as business research==\r\n\r\n'''Reverse engineering''' is also used by businesses to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyze, for instance, how a competitor's product works, what it does, who manufactures it, what components it consists of, estimate costs, identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.\r\n\r\n'''Value engineering''' is a related activity also used by business. It involves deconstructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.\r\n\r\n==See also==\r\n\r\n*[[Clean room design]]\r\n*[[Value engineering]]\r\n*[[List of production topics]]\r\n\r\n==External link==\r\n\r\n* [http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigmil/RevEng/ Introduction to Reverse Engineering Software],  preprint of a book by Mike Perry and Nasko Oskov.", "timestamp": "2003-11-19T16:39:57Z", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "revid": 1775604, "contentmodel": "wikitext", "user": "The Anome", "parentid": 1771276}], "title": "Reverse engineering"}}}}
